My Personal Website. Description and Information about me. 

## Description
I wanted to learn and practice web development in ReactJs, so I decided to build my website in a week over the Semester 1 break. The website is developed using ReactJs and a few other UI component libraries. My personal website is still a work in progress, and I'm currently looking for designers to help give me feedback on where I can better my website. Please get in touch with me if you have any interesting ideas on how to make my website better.

## Installation
To run my website locally, first clone the repository, and then in a command line, run 
``` 
npm install 
npm run
``` 
## Roadmap/To-do's
As of 08/07/2020, I am currently working on the projects page. The current projects page is designed in cards, so I am looking to find different ways of showcasing these projects.
